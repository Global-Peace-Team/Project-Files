<h1>Us vs Them Analysis - Chapter 2 of the Quran</h1>
<p><strong>Summary:</strong> This analysis classifies each verse in Chapter 2 of the Quran according to in-group (Us) and out-group (Them) references. Chapter 2 is often called a ‚ÄúMini Quran‚Äù and serves as a strong representation of the whole Quran. A full Quran analysis yielded a similar pattern with ~86.6% of verses referencing Us/Them elements.</p>

<h2 id='notes'>Explanatory Notes</h2>
<p>This analysis reveals that the overwhelming majority of verses in Chapter 2 of the Quran are framed around an in-group vs. out-group worldview. By tagging each verse based on whether it refers to 'Us' (Muslims, Allah, believers, etc.) or 'Them' (disbelievers, hypocrites, Jews, Christians, etc.), and further categorizing antagonistic or dehumanizing tones, we expose a core narrative structure of the Quran that is often overlooked in traditional exegesis.</p>
<p>Most readers, apologists, and scholars miss this repeated pattern due to selective readings or thematic clustering. However, when each verse is analyzed line-by-line, this 'Us versus Them' motif emerges clearly and pervasively.</p>
<p><strong>Why Chapter 2?</strong> Chapter 2 is widely regarded as a 'Mini Quran' because it spans all major themes present in the entire text. A full Quran-wide analysis shows that approximately 86.6% of all 6236 verses also exhibit Us/Them features, confirming that Chapter 2 serves as a near-representative sample of the whole Quran.</p>
<p>Recognizing this structure is essential to understanding the doctrinal roots of conflict and exclusivity emphasized in certain interpretations of the Quran.</p>

<h2 id="h8-science">Scientific Evidence Supporting H8 (Us vs Them)</h2>
<p>The following scientific studies from evolutionary psychology, social neuroscience, and genocide research support the core idea behind the SLOPE variable <strong>H8 ‚Äì Hyper-Differentiation (Us vs Them)</strong>. These studies show that tribal behavior, moral exclusion, and violence against out-groups are not random but rooted in deep psychological mechanisms that, when reinforced by ideological narratives, can lead to systemic evil.</p>
